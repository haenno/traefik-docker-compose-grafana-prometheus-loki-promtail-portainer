# Full featured traefik proxy with monitoring and logs

Example of a traefik proxy with monitoring and logs active using:

- node-exporter:v1.6.1
- grafana/promtail:2.9.0
- grafana/loki:2.9.0
- grafana/grafana:10.0.5
- prom/prometheus:v2.47.0
- traefik:2.10.4
- portainer/portainer-ce:2.19.0

**Note:** This is not a production ready setup. Its missing the whole HTTPS, letsencript and non-root-docker part. It is just a example of how to use traefik with monitoring and logs with all the current versions of the used tools fitting well together (what was kind of a hassle ðŸ‘¼).

## Installation and start

- Clone this repo
- Copy or rename the file ``example.env`` to ``.env``
- Start the infrastructure and two sample apps

```shell
docker-compose -f proxy-docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f apps-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

## Usage

- Open the traefik dashboard at <http://t.localhost> using the credentials **username**:*admin* and **password**:*admin*

- Open the grafana dashboard to see all the dashboards at <http://g.localhost> using the credentials *admin/admin*, then set a new password also with credentials *admin/admin*

- Open the sample apps at <http://web1.localhost> and <http://web2.localhost>
- Maybe create some sample data and errors for the dashboard to show by visiting <http://web1.localhost/error> and <http://web2.localhost/error>

After you passed the basic-auth with *admin/admin* you can set a new password for the admin user in Grfana.
